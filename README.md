# Chichewa Sign Language CNN Model Development 📘

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to design, train, and evaluate a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for Chichewa Sign Language recognition.

It is intended to complement the real-time detection application by showing how the deep learning model was built before deployment.

## 📁 What’s Inside

- `train_csl_model.ipynb`: The full notebook showing:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - CNN architecture definition
  - Training and validation process
  - Model performance metrics

- `data/`: Folder containing sign language image dataset (e.g., SL-MNIST or local CSL dataset)
- `model/`: Trained TensorFlow `.h5` model file (`chichewa_sign_language.h5`)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for reproducibility

## 🧠 Goal

To document the development of a deep learning model for Chichewa Sign Language (CSL) using TensorFlow/Keras, and support its integration into a web-based gesture recognition system.
